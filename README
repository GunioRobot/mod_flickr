  Apache module for flickr access.
  Needs the API key and shared secret.

  API call:
	http://www.whatsoever.com/<username>/<page>

  where <username> is the username of the configured user in the httpd configuration file (See CONFIGURATION)
	    <page> is the page number for the requested photos.

  mod_flickr returns metadata for 30 photos per call (i.e. per page) which is currently not configurable.
  (unless you change the code and recompile it, which you are most welcome to do.). The call needs to be
  made using AJAX from the frontend (for better user experience). Also frontend need to process the XML
  returned and consturct the thumbnal URL. (code not yet written yet but is trivial for any JS/AJAX prorammer).

  1. INSTALLATION
        mod_flickr needs libcurl and any *nix/*BSD system. You may need to edit the paths in the 'Makefile' (INCLDIR/LIBDIR) to specify the include and the library
        paths for libcurl includes and shared library. (need to provide `configure' script for this, later)

        % make all      # make sure `apxs' is in $PATH else edit the Makefile giving the full path for `apxs'

  2. CONFIGURATION

  *Apache configuration entries (httpd.conf)

	LoadModule mod_flickr   libexec/apache22/mod_flickr.so		# see apache manuals on how to load DSO's.

	FlickrMod       On
	FlickrUser      vshankar
	FlickrKey       vshankar xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	FlickrSecret    vshankar xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	FlickrAuth      vshankar xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

	The above config. is for a single user. Likewise more than one user can be configured provided you have their credentials. (for e.g. you can have 2-3 flickr  	accouts	and configure and use the name in the URL to get their respective photos)

  3. TODO
	Displaying "interesting" photos.
	Photo set for the user.
	Handle upload/view photos for a perticular photo set.
	Support for flickr blogs etc...
