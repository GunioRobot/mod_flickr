mod_flickr is a apache module (for apache 2.0 and above) that calls flickr API's
for a configured used (in httpd.conf) to get his public photos, sets, photos
in sets and recent photos uploaded in flickr by everyone.

Currently only 4 api calls have been implmeneted, as described above) and all
API's return data in XML format. The XML can then be parsed by the calling code
(e.g. front end Javascript/AJAX) to display thumbnails of the images say in a
scrollbar. (Code for js/ajax is not distributed as yet but should be trivial for
anyone who has it's knowledge)

0. INSTALLATION
---------------
        mod_flickr needs libcurl and any *nix/*BSD system. You may need to edit the paths in the 'Makefile' (INCLDIR/LIBDIR) to specify the include and the library
        paths for libcurl includes and shared library. (need to provide `configure' script for this, later)

        % make 		# make sure `apxs' is in $PATH else edit the Makefile giving the full path for `apxs'

Apache configuration (httpd.conf)
--------------------------------

1. Make sure you have the following line in the Apache
   configuration file (noramlly httpd.conf)

	LoadModule mod_flickr   libexec/apache22/mod_flickr.so    # see apache manuals on how to load DSO's.

2. Also to activate mod_flickr and to configure the user
   the following lines need to be added in apache conf. file.

	2.a Activate the flickr module
		FlickrMod       On

	2.b Provide the reuired key, secret and auth-token as
		follows. <user> is the name of the user that will
		be called as a part of the URI (see below, step 4).
		Enter the key, secret and auth-token in place of
		'xxxx' in repective directives

	FlickrUser      <user>
	FlickrKey       <user>	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	FlickrSecret    <user>	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	FlickrAuth      <user>	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

3. Enter the following so that the request reached mod_flickr
   handler.

	<Location /flickr>
		SetHandler	flickr-handler
	</Location>

4. URL formats:
   If you have configured apache as per Step 3, then the
   format to call flickr module would be:

	http://whatsoever.com/flickr/<user>/<api>/<arguments/to/the/api>

	e.g. http://whatsoever.com/flickr/vshankar/getMyPhotos/1
	This would fetch the public photos for user 'vshankar'
	(actually whatever 'vshankar' maps to the keys). mod_flickr
	supports four api calls. (see below)
